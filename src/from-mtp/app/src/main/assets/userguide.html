<h1>MapThePaths Android app</h1>
<hr/>
<p>
    This is the accompanying app to
    <a href='https://www.mapthepaths.org.uk'>MapThePaths</a>,
    a project to add all the rights of way (RoWs) and permissive paths in England and Wales to
    OpenStreetMap
    (OSM) fully tagged. The app helps you find the locations of council RoWs and RoWs already on OSM
    while
    actually out surveying, helping you locate where there are missing paths or paths without a
    designation
    tag on OSM. It also allows you to <em>record a tagged GPS trace</em> in which you can tag
    sections of the trace with the path designation and surface type.</p>
<h2>Map key</h2>
<p>The colour scheme used is as follows (thicker lighter lines are council data and thinner
    darker lines are OSM data):
</p>
<ul>
    <li>green = public footpath</li>
    <li>brown = public bridleway</li>
    <li>magenta = restricted byway</li>
    <li>red = byway open to all traffic</li>
    <li>light blue = permissive footpath</li>
    <li>grey = anything else (road, path not marked as RoW or permissive)</li>
</ul>


<h2>Using the MapThePaths app</h2>
<h3>What can you do?</h3>
<p>The app allows you to:
<ul>
    <li>View council RoW data overlaid with OSM data, much like the MapThePaths website;</li>
    <li>Download <strong>live OSM data from the OpenStreetMap API</strong>. This should be used for
        editing purposes only. You can update the designation of live data by long-pressing on an
        OSM way and then selecting the "Change designation of selected way" menu option.
        To avoid copyright violation, <strong>please only do this via on the ground
            observations, not
            by copying the designation from council data!</strong>
    <li><strong>Record tagged GPS traces</strong>. Using the dropdown lists at the top of the
        screen you can tag sections of your route with the path designation (public footpath,
        public bridleway etc) and path type (grass path, track, etc). These tagged traces can
        then be uploaded to the OpenStreetMap site, or opened in JOSM helping you add new data
        to OSM. It is hoped in the future (time permitting!) to develop a JOSM plugin to
        colour-code these tagged traces according to right of way type, further easing the
        creation of new OSM data.
    </li>
</ul>
<h3>View mode</h3>
<p>You can select the mode ("View" or "Live OSM Edit") via the bottom navigation view on the app.
    "View"
    mode is the default. It provides a view much like the MapThePaths website itself; it shows
    council
    RoW data (in thicker, lighter lines) overlaid by OpenStreetMap data from the Freemap server (in
    thinner,
    darker lines) coloured according to RoW designation. Thus, "view" mode allows you to easily
    identify which
    RoWs are missing on OSM and which are lacking a designation, as paths without a designation will
    appear
    in grey. To view the data you must select "Download council and OSM data" from the menu
    system.</p>
<p>You can use "Live OSM Edit" mode, below to add a designation but <strong>do not copy the council
    data
</strong>, as not all councils license their data in a way which is compatible with OSM. Instead,
    <strong>add designations only via on-the-ground observation.</strong></p>
<p>Note that <strong>the OSM data in "View" mode is not live OSM data</strong>. It is OSM data
    provided
    by the <a href='https://www.free-map.org.uk'>Freemap</a> server, which is normally up to a week,
    sometimes two weeks, old. So it
    is possible that an apparently-missing footpath has been surveyed in the meantime. You can use
    "Live OSM Edit"
    mode to check the live OSM data to be absolutely sure.</p>

<h3>Live OSM Edit mode</h3>
<p>"Live OSM Edit" mode allows you to change the designation of a path. It works
    with live OSM data from the OSM API, so you must select "Download live OSM data" from the menu
    first and you must
    login to OSM (via the "Login to OSM" menu option). Use your normal OSM account.
</p>
<p>To change the designation of a path, long-press on it. A dialog will appear with different
    designation
    options, listing the various RoW classifications plus permissive path (the latter can be useful
    if you
    discover that a path has permissive access). This will be updated live on OSM as soon as you
    select the
    new designation.</p>
<h2>Adding notes</h2>
<p>When logged in, you can also add notes for other mappers, e.g. make a note that a hedge is either
    to the
    left or to the right of the path. The note button is available in both "View" and "Live OSM
    Edit"
    modes.</p>
<h2>Performance issues</h2>
<p>The app uses a forked version of the Ordnance Survey OpenSpace SDK for Android
    (see <a href='https://github.com/nickw1/openspace-android-sdk'>here</a>). Paths are added to the
    Ordnance Survey Vector Map District base layer as vector lines; performance can be poor if you
    attempt to use the app in an urban area due to sheer volume of data. I found that on a Nexus 5
    it is slow in urban areas but on a Nexus 9 tablet, significantly faster. Please note that
    <strong>the app is not optimised for urban areas</strong>, its intended use is in the
    countryside.
    Small towns will be fine though (based on tests in Southampton and Romsey).</p>


<h2>Recording a tagged GPS trace</h2>

<p>MapThePaths also allows you to record tagged GPS traces. Press the red &quot;record&quot; button
    to
    start recording. GPS traces are tagged with the path designation (public footpath, etc)
    and path type (grass path, track, etc), which can be selected from the dropdown lists at the
    top of the screen. When recording, press the black &quot;stop&quot; button to stop. You can then
    upload the trace to OpenStreetMap using the cloud icon on the action bar at the top of the
    screen.
</p>
<h3>Waypoints</h3>
<p>GPS waypoints are also recorded wheneve the designation or path type changes. These are
    labelled with the new designation and path type. <strong>This
        can assist you if you wish to use your trace to edit in JOSM later</strong>, as the
    waypoints will
    mark a change in either of these two path properties.</p>
<h3>Saving the GPS trace</h3>
<p>GPS traces are saved on the device in GPX format under the <em>mapthepaths</em> folder. The
    current survey is saved as <em>mapthepathsCurrentSurvey.gpx</em>; whenever you upload a GPS
    survey or
    select <em>New track</em> from the menu, you will be prompted for a filename
    to save the track as a GPX file. If you leave the filename blank, an auto-generated name
    with the track's timestamp will be used.
</p>
<h3>Uploading traces later</h3>
<p>You can upload previously-saved traces OpenStreetMap (as
    above), by selecting &quot;Upload saved track&quot; from the menu.</p>

<h2>Bug reporting</h2>

<p>The app has been extensively tested, however it is always possible that a bug may occur,
    If a bug occurs please
    <em>email the developer</em>, Nick Whitelegg on hikar.app@gmail.com, stating the latitude and
    longitude where the error occurred and what you were doing at the time.</p>
<h2>Obtaining the source code</h2>

<p>Source code is available
    <a href='https://gitlab.com/nickw1/mapthepaths-android'>here</a>.
</p>

<h2>Privacy policy</h2>
<p>The MapThePaths app will track your GPS location, in order to download mapping information
    for your current area and to allow you to record a route. Using the OAuth authentication system,
    the app also stores a unique &quot;token&quot; to identify
    you to OSM once you have logged in; this is stored on the device between uses of MapThePaths
    to avoid you having to login each time.
    Edits you make (whether adding a note, or changing the designation of an existing
    way) will be attributable to you on OSM. However, the app does NOT store your OSM
    username or password on the device. It is OpenStreetMap itself which validates your username
    and password. </p>
<h3>GPS trace uploading: privacy issues</h3>
<p>GPS traces are uploaded to <em>OSM</em> in Public mode, which means that other users can
    identify
    you as the surveyor of the track. To quote from the
    <a href='https://wiki.openstreetmap.org/wiki/Visibility_of_GPS_traces'>OpenStreetMap
        wiki</a>, this means that &quot;the trace will be shown publicly in Your GPS traces and in
    public
    GPS trace
    listings. Data served via the API does not reference your trace page. Timestamps of the trace
    points are not available through the public GPS API,
    and the points are not chronologically ordered. However, other users are still able to download
    the raw trace from the public trace list and any timestamps contained within.&quot;</p>
